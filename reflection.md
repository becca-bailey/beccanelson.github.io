**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

While formatting my blog page, I learned about the CSS box-sizing property, which allows you to add margins and padding while still taking up the same percentage of space on the page.  It's especially helpful for responsive design when floating elements like main content and a sidebar.  

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I learned that CSS positioning won't work unless your html tags are correct!  I spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out why my footer wouldn't clear both the main content and the sidebar, and it turned out that my CSS was right, but I had left out a closing HTML tag that didn't allow me to position my elements correctly.  

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement?  What was most difficult?**

It was easy to define the general layout, and to make it match the wireframes.  What was more difficult was fixing the smaller details--padding and margin especially.  Even when linking a reset file, I still had to frequently use the Chrome inspector tools to see where I needed to override default browser styles.  Though this isn't a technical challenge, I always find time boxing difficult when working on a project like this.  It's never "done", and there's always one more thing to work on.  There's always more I can do, and it's hard to know when to stop.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

I learned that CSS involves a lot of trial and error.  In this trial-and-error process, I explored the benefits and drawbacks of adding an image with html vs. using the CSS background-image property, learned some new techniques for making my site responsive, and experimented with different ways to accomplish the same thing.
