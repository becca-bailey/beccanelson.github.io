        <h2 class="post-title">Gitting it Together: Reflections on Version Control</h2>
        <p class="post-meta">September 10, 2015</p>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>When I first started to explore web development, I remember searching for templates and code samples, which inevitably led me to GitHub. I had this idea that only "real" developers used GitHub, and it was this wonderful universe for the highly-intelligent super-humans who know how to use it. Now that I have discovered version control, I still think about it that way, except I now count myself among the highly intelligent super-humans who know how to use it.</p>

          <p>So, apart from making you look like a "real" developer, version control just makes sense. It's like a time machine that allows you go track changes and store all the earlier versions of your files. It also helps to resolve arguments on a team, as you don't have to worry about overwriting anyone else's code or sending multiple copies of a file back and forth. Seeing everyone's changes in one place makes your life much easier.</p>

          <p>Git is the most common program for version control. Git allows you store your changes in "commits", or snapshots of your files as they exist right now. This can be a code, text, or even an image file. You can keep these commits to yourself on your own computer, or you can show off your stuff by pushing these commits to GitHub.</p>

          <p>**Very Important Note:** Git is NOT the same thing as GitHub. Git is a program you can use on your own computer without ever posting anything on GitHub. Pushing to GitHub is optional, though like I said, it makes you look like a highly-intelligent super-human.</p>

          <p>GitHub is a community. As we write code and become better developers, we're not doing it alone—we're sharing the experience with others, too. And that, to me, is the best part.</p>
