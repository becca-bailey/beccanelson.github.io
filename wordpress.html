    Here are a couple smaller WordPress projects I've worked on.

        Stacey wanted to make better use of header space on her blog. I changed the CSS positioning of her header image and navigation menu for a slightly updated look and a better use of space.  I also did some minor fixes to make sure her header is still flexible and mobile-responsive.

        Autumn needed some help making minor changes to her site.  I was able to fix some errors in the CSS which were making it difficult for her to correctly size her header image.  I also made some minor fixes, such as spacing, font-size, and background color to make her blog beautiful!
