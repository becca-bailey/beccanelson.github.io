        This is my Dev Bootcamp final project which my team and I completed in one week.  Our goal was to create a visual organization system for images, documents, and files built on Ruby on Rails.  BrightFolio uses Amazon Web Services S3 for file storage, and our focus was on UI features such as easy navigation and interactive front-end javascript.

      <p>
        This was a Dev Bootcamp client project built on Ruby on Rails.  My primary contribution to this project was an email invite system built with Action Mailer which allows users to invite a new or existing user to join a group using an automatically-generated secret token.

           <p> This is my first project with JavaScript.  My goal was to make a simple Yahtzee game that takes user input to manipulate two arrays, and will check for patterns in the final array.  This is a work-in progress, as I am currently working on represeting the dice in both arrays with selectable graphics. </p><br>

            <p>This is a Dev Bootcamp solo challenge, designed to be a cheat sheet for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby.  Starting with a wireframe, I created the layout with HTML, added style with CSS, and added a JavaScript hide/show effect for each category. </p><br>

            <p>This was a Dev Bootcamp challenge which involved creating a JavaScript object to store multiple grocery lists, items, and quantities.  I took this challenge a step further by turning it into a simple web application.</p><br>
