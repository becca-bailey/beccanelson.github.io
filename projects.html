           <p> This is my first project with JavaScript.  My goal was to make a simple Yahtzee game that takes user input to manipulate two arrays, and will check for patterns in the final array.  This is a work-in progress, as I am currently working on represeting the dice in both arrays with selectable graphics. </p><br>

            <p>This is a Dev Bootcamp solo challenge, designed to be a cheat sheet for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby.  Starting with a wireframe, I created the layout with HTML, added style with CSS, and added a JavaScript hide/show effect for each category. </p><br>

            <p>This was a Dev Bootcamp challenge which involved creating a JavaScript object to store multiple grocery lists, items, and quantities.  I took this challenge a step further by turning it into a simple web application.</p><br>
