          ### If you're a fan of testing Clojure with [Speclj](https://github.com/slagyr/speclj), you will be glad to know that it's very simple to integrate with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). If you're new to Travis, Travis is an automatic service that connects to a Github...

          This week, I am working on optimizing my Clojure minimax algorithm for my terminal tic-tac-toe game. At first, my goal was just to implement the algorithm and make it unbeatable. But once I did that, I discovered a problem. It...

        <p class="excerpt">
          Ever since I started learning to code, I've been interested in the similarity between learning a spoken language and a programming language. For example, [translation from one language to another](/lost-in-translation) doesn't always result in the idiomatic usage of a new...

        <p class="excerpt">
          Rebasing just sounds scary, doesn't it? Beginners (like myself) tend to follow the typical `add`, `commit`, `merge`, and `push` workflow, and everything else invokes the mortal dread of making a mistake that is irreversible, meaning our code will be lost,...
