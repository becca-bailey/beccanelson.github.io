          ### This week, I've been re-factoring [The Gilded Rose in Clojure]("https://github.com/mjansen401/gilded-rose-clojure") The Gilded Rose is an exercise in testing and re-factoring, and let me tell you, it's a mess! [Check this out](https://github.com/mjansen401/gilded-rose-clojure/blob/master/src/gilded_rose/core.clj) if you don't know what I'm talking about....
