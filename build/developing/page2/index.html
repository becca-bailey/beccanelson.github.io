          As the final piece of my pairing project, we were asked to build a JavaScript client for our tic-tac-toe application in addition to the iOS application in Swift we had already built. In JavaScript land, though, it's pretty rare to...

          One thing that I found particularly annoying about Java was the fact that there wasn't a good way to create a default implementation of a particular method in an interface without creating abstract classes. However, Swift allows you to create...

          Work-life balance can be a tricky thing. While some companies try to create a culture where it is a priority, not all do. In fact, some companies specifically seek out the ones who wear busyness like a badge of honor,...

          As we have been re-factoring our iOS tic tac toe application, we have been thinking pretty carefully about design patterns. For example, I have written before about using an [interactor class](/iOS-view-interactions) and [testing with protocols and mocks](/testing-using-protocols-and-mocks). Similarly, another principle...

          Swift is a very young language, and one of the joys of working with such a young language is just how quickly tutorials and documentation become outdated with each update. I can't tell you how many times I have turned...
