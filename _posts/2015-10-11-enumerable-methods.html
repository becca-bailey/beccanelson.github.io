<p>If you're new to Ruby, you may have noticed there are a lot of different methods you can use, particulary when working with arrays.  Here's a new one I discovered this week.</p>

<p>Let's say you have an array of numbers, and you need to add ten to each one.</p>

<code>numbers=[26, 3, 90, 45, 15]</code>

<p>You could use the <code>each</code> method to print them out, like this.</p>

<code>numbers.each do |n| <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;n += 10 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;p n + " " <br>
end <br>
=> 36 13 100 55 25 </code>

<p>But what if you still wanted an array?  This is where you can use the <code>map</code> method to apply a code block to each item in an array.</p>

<code>numbers.map { |n| n += 10 } <br>
=> [36, 13, 100, 55, 25]</code>

<p>But, now look what happens when we print the array.</p>

<code>p numbers <br>
=> [26, 3, 90, 45, 15]</code>

<p>Ruby will return the original array, becuase map is by default a non-destructive method.  If you want to make a method destructive (or as we like to say—"dangerous"), you can add a <code>!</code>, also called a <em>bang</em>.  This sybol doesn't just mean you're doing something enthusiastically—it also means you are changing the original array.  Now let's see what happens.</p>

<code>numbers.map! { |n| n += 10 } <br>
=> [36, 13, 100, 55, 25] <br>
p numbers <br>
=> [36, 13, 100, 55, 25]</code>

<p>Now, I have one more trick to show you.</p>

<code>numbers.collect! { |n| n += 10 } <br>
=> [36, 13, 100, 55, 25] </code><br>

<p>See what I did there?  The <code>collect</code> method does the same thing as <code>map</code>.  "What's the difference?" you might ask.  My brilliant answer:  there is none.  They are exactly the same.  <em>Why, Ruby.... whyyyyy??</em> </p>

<p>Did you now that before?  Well, you do now.</p>
