          <li><p>I am a multipotentialite.  If you don't know what that means, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJORi5VO1F8">this video</a>.</p></li>
          <li><p>I like to <a href="http://www.beccanelsonwrites.com">write things</a>, and sometimes make small amounts of money as a <a href="http://www.beccanelsonmakesthings.com">WordPress developer</a>.</p></li>
          <li><p>My college degree is in Music Education.  I have worked as an elementary music teacher, an art teacher, and a traveling choir director.  I am awesome at playing the recorder.</p></li>
          <li><p>Last year, I lived in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala.  I dare you to find that on a map (without Google).</p></li>
