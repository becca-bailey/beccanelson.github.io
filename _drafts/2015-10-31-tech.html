<p>If you've been learning tech skills for a while now, I'm sure you've heard a lot about Ruby on Rails and how it can be used to build web apps.  But what is Rails, exactly?</p>

<p>If you're not sure, <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2015/01/29/13-ruby-rails/">this is a good place to start</a>.</p>

<h3>Here's the basic idea:</h3>

<p>Ruby is a great programming language on its own, but needs a little help to program the web.  Unlike CSS, HTML, and JavaScript which are built into all web browsers, in order to work on the web, Ruby needs a framework, the most common being Rails.  Rails has been used to build popular sites like <a href="http://www.airbnb.com">Air BnB</a>, <a href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribble</a>, and even <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>  

<p>To learn a little more about Rails, I went through the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Getting Started with Rails</a> tutorial at RailsGuides.</p>

<h3>Here's what I learned:</h3>

<p>Well, first I learned that there's a LOT to learn.  While installing Rails and setting up your first project file is a simple process, it will take more time to fully understand what's going on.</p>

<p>Once you have installed Rails and initialized a new project, Rails automatically generates a new project directory, which looks like this.</p>

<p>While I'm not going to take you through the whole tutorial, here are some interesting bits of information I learned in the process.</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Though Rails can help to build the back-end of a mobile app, Rails itself doesn't build mobile apps for iOS and</li>
<li>Rails is a package library (more specically a Ruby Gem) that can be installed and operated using the command line.</li>
<li>Rails is said to be "opinionated", meaning it is less flexible than Ruby alone, and requires the developer to learn the "right" way to program.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>So basically, Rails is a HUGE topic that would take a lot of time to fully explore, and I'm sure there will be plenty of time for that in Phases 1, 2, and 3 of Dev Bootcamp.  But for now, here's some more resources to get started.</p>
