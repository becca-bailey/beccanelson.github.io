<p>While learning Ruby, one of the hardest concepts for me to grasp has been <em>object-oriented programming</em>.  At first it seemed pretty unnecessary, and it made more sense just to keep creating regular old local variables and telling the computer what to do.</p>

<p>But, in an object-oriented language like Ruby or JavaScript, that makes about as much sense as being this cat, trying to program a computer.  So instead, I'm going to program this cat.</p>

<p>First, I need to create a class.</p>

<code class="ruby">class Cat</code>

<p>This makes 'Cat' an object (or in this case, a warm-blooded quadriped).  We're going to give this cat a name, a breed, and a status.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
attr_reader :name, :breed, :hungry?, :mood
def Initialize(name, breed)
@name = name 
@breed = breed 
@hungry? = true
@mood = 'unhappy' 
end
</code></pre>

<p>In English, this means that we can access the cat's name, breed and status outside of the class.  Also, they are now <em>instance variables</em>, meaning they can be accessed in other methods within the class.  I can now create a new cat.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
gilbert = Cat.new('Gilbert', 'American Shorthair')

gilbert.name
=> "Gilbert" 

gilbert.breed 
=> "American Shorthair"
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if I wanted to change Gilbert's name to Phil, I couldn't do that unless I changed :name to attr_accessor.  I don't really want to do that, though.  Now, I have a hungry and unhappy cat.  How can I fix that, I wonder?  Maybe I should write a method that goes inside the Cat class.</p> 

<pre><code class="ruby">
def feed
@hungry? = false
end

def pet
@mood = 'happy'
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I can feed and pet my cat by calling these methods outside of the class.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
gilbert.feed
gilbert.pet

gilbert.hungry?
=> false

gilbert.mood
=> "happy"
</code></pre>

        <p>See, now I have a happy kitty.  Isn't it amazing what classes can do?  If only real pets were this easily pleased.  </p>
